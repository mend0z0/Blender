    - Drawing peripheral functions block diagram (CLK, GPIO, TIMER 0, TIMER 1, TIMER 2, TIMER 3, I2C, DMA, RTC, SPDIF, I2S, ADC, UART, WDT)
    - 
    - Drawing each module/device API/Init functions block diagram (Ind LED, SSD1306, Toslink, WS2812, DMX, VGA, PAM8003, PCM1754)
    - Writing C code for the drawn block diagram
    - Writing C code for the ISR
