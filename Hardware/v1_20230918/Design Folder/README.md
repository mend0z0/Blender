## Tasks

- #### MUST DO (List the works that proper working of project depends on these tasks):
    - Correcting the power ports labels.?
    - Labeling correction (Correcting that @ shit in the info label on the PCB). (Next revision)
    - Checking circuitry and adding information
    - Adding Mechanical parts (Wire, XLR connector, inline connector for ws2812, OLED, some standoffs, screws, and enclosure, 2 x speaker).
    - Doing the Power sequence analysis
    - Exporting output files
    - Adding info to Coverpage
    - Correcting the information for each page
    - 
    - Very important, changing the MOSFET part number to SI4435FDY-T1-GE3 (https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/vishay-siliconix/SI4435FDY-T1-GE3/7566600). (Next revision)
